# Snapchat Filters Catalog

A responsive web application that showcases a catalog of Snapchat filters with search, filtering, and sorting capabilities.

## Project Overview

This catalog was created for the Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript data structures (arrays and objects) and various data manipulation operations in a visually appealing interface.


## Features

- **Comprehensive Filter Data**: Detailed information on 24 Snapchat filters including release dates, popularity ratings, categories, and features
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering as users type in the search box
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by Face, World, Interactive, Trending, and Special categories
- **Multiple Sorting Options**: Sort by newest, oldest, popularity, or alphabetically
- **Dual View Modes**: Toggle between grid and list views
- **Favorites System**: Mark filters as favorites and save preferences using local storage
- **Detailed Filter View**: Click on any filter to see detailed information in a modal
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Implementation

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with proper accessibility considerations
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with Snapchat's branding colors, flexbox, and grid layouts
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for all functionality without external libraries
- **Local Storage**: For persisting user favorites
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: For typography (Poppins font family)

## Data Structure

The application uses an array of filter objects, with each object containing:
- ID
- Name
- Category
- Release date
- Description
- Popularity rating
- Image URL
- Features array
- Favorite status

This structure demonstrates the use of complex data structures to organize and manipulate information.

## Data Operations

1. **Search**: Filters the array based on user input text
2. **Category Filtering**: Uses array filtering methods to show only selected categories
3. **Sorting**: Implements various sorting algorithms based on user selection
4. **Favorites System**: Updates object properties and save to local storage
5. **View Toggle**: Changes data presentation format without altering the underlying data

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. No build tools or dependencies required!

## Future Improvements

- Add animation effects for smoother transitions
- Implement filter tags for more specific filtering
- Create user accounts to save preferences across devices
- Expand the dataset with more filters and categories
- Add AR preview functionality
